## Melanoma Detection Assignment

## Abstract
In cancer, there are over 200 different forms. Out of 200, melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer. The diagnostic procedure for melanoma starts with clinical screening, followed by dermoscopic analysis and histopathological examination. Melanoma skin cancer is highly curable if it gets identified at the early stages. The first step of Melanoma skin cancer diagnosis is to conduct a visual examination of the skin's affected area. Dermatologists take the dermatoscopic images of the skin lesions by the high-speed camera, which have an accuracy of 65-80% in the melanoma diagnosis without any additional technical support. With further visual examination by cancer treatment specialists and dermatoscopic images, the overall prediction rate of melanoma diagnosis raised to 75-84% accuracy. The project aims to build an automated classification system based on image processing techniques to classify skin cancer using skin lesions images.

## Problem Statement
 In the skin biopsy, the dermatologist takes some part of the skin lesion and examines it under the microscope. The current process takes almost a week or more, starting from getting a dermatologist appointment to getting a biopsy report.
 The aims to shorten the current gap to just a couple of days by providing the predictive model.
 The approach uses Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify nine types of skin cancer from outlier lesions images. This reduction of a gap has the opportunity to impact millions of people positively.

## Motivation
The overarching goal is to support the efforts to reduce the death caused by skin cancer. The primary motivation that drives the project is to use the advanced image classification technology for the well-being of the people. Computer vision has made good progress in machine learning and deep learning that are scalable across domains.
> Skin cancer detection with artificial intelligence. We analysed different convolutional neural networks for melanoma detection to   select the most accurate method for this purpose. In our solution, we used different base models with the same top layers to detect melanoma images from others images.

## General Information
Among skin cancer diseases, melanoma is one of the most common and most dangerous ones, being difficult to detect and causing serious problems once spread deeper. Melanomas have many different shapes, sizes, and colours, thus making it harder to provide comprehensive warning signs. Detecting melanoma early is of utmost importance. Neural Networks provide significant progress in this field, making it possible to detect melanomas with many previously learned patterns, dealing with larger datasets than a human specialist can handle.
